* This project begins in the first stage, where we focus on modeling a fundamental microwave component, the microstrip line. This foundational step provides us with a comprehensive understanding of the intricate microwave domain
* Building upon this knowledge, we move to the second stage, where we harness the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This stage is dedicated to addressing the one-to-one mapping issue and resolving non-uniqueness problems encountered in predicting physical parameters.
* Our exploration of GANs offers invaluable insights and sets the stage for the next phase.
* In the third and final stage, we introduce a robust Neural Network model, meticulously designed to predict the percentage change in physical parameters. This innovative approach, based on resonant frequency and dB, promises enhanced precision in electromagnetic system design.
